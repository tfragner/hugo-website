## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v0.29.0:

- Requires Hugo 0.30.2+
-  View `config.toml` [changes](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v0.29.0...v2.0.0#diff-991d2a2fe208cdee83955ad6e9a323a7)
- Changes to parameters in widgets and content frontmatter - refer to **[Breaking Change]** notices in the following section below. If any errors arise, we recommend comparing the frontmatter of the updated [example site content](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/v2.0.0/exampleSite/content) with the frontmatter parameters in your content files.
- Translations: if you are using a non-English or customized language file, the relevant translation in `themes/academic/i18n/` may require updating based on the [changes to the English language file](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v0.29.0...v2.0.0#diff-916a95a0463ea1bd7c2d26bd73fbc9b2). English, Chinese, French, and Spanish appear to be up-to-date.
- If your publication and talk abstracts contain math, they may require further [escaping](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#rm-latex-math) to prevent them being parsed as Markdown
