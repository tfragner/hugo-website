It is possible to carry out many customizations *without* editing any code in the `themes/academic/` folder, making it easier to update the framework in the future.

## Menu

The `[[menu.main]]` entries towards the bottom of `config.toml` define the navigation links at the top of the website. They can be added or removed as desired.

To create a dropdown sub-menu, add `identifier = "something"` to the parent item and `parent = "something"` to the child item.

## Website icon

Save your main icon and mobile icon as square PNG images named `icon.png` (32x32 pixels) and `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels), respectively. Place them in your root `static/img/` folder.

## Analytics

To enable [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics), add your tracking code in `config.toml` similarly to `googleAnalytics = "UA-12345678-9"`.

## Add scripts (JS)

To add a **third party script**, create a file named `head_custom.html` in a `layouts/partials/` folder at the root of your website (not in the `themes` folder). Any HTML code added to this file will be included within your website's `<head>`. Therefore, it's suitable for adding custom metadata or third party scripts specified with the *async* attribute.

Whereas for your own **local scripts**, you can link your local JS assets (relative to your root `static/js`) from your `config.toml` using `custom_js  = ["custom.js"]`.

## Permalinks

*Permalinks*, or *permanent links*, are URLs to individual pages and posts on your website. They are permanent web addresses which can be used to link to your content. Using Hugo's *permalinks* option these can be easily customized. For example, the blog post URL can be changed to the form *yourURL/2016/05/01/my-post-slug* by adding the following near the top of your `config.toml` (before `[params]` settings):

    [permalinks]
        post = "/:year/:month/:day/:slug"

Where `:slug` defaults to the filename of the post, excluding the file extension. However, slug may be overridden on a per post basis if desired, simply by setting `slug = "my-short-post-title"` in your post preamble.

**Example 2:** let's consider changing the URL path of posts from `post/` to `blog/`. First, add the following parameters right above the `[params]` section of your `config.toml`:
```
[permalinks]
    post = "/blog/:slug"
```
Then add `aliases = ["/blog/"]` to your post archive page `post/_index.md` so that it can be accessed from the */blog/* URL.

## Customize style (CSS)

For advanced customization of the style, you can link custom CSS assets (relative to your root `static/css`) from your `config.toml` using `custom_css = ["custom.css"]`.

For example, let's override some of Academic's default styles. First, define `custom_css = ["override.css"]` in `config.toml`. Then we can create the file `static/css/override.css`, relative to your website root (i.e. **not** in the `themes` directory). Add your custom CSS to this file.

## Override a template

Hugo uses a [template lookup](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/) which enables you to override any of Academic's files without directly changing them. This can make it easier to update Academic in the future since you do not modify any of Academic's files directly.

To override a template in the theme, you simply copy the file you are interested in from `themes/academic/` and paste it in your site folder using a similar path. To understand how this works, you should familiarize yourself with template lookup. Finally, when you update Academic, remember to compare your version of the file against Academic's one, in case you need to propagate any changes across.

For example, say we wish to add some HTML code to the navigation bar. Let's copy the relevant file `themes/academic/layout/partials/navbar.html` to `layout/partials/navbar.html` (at the root of your site, **not** in `themes/academic/`), creating the `layout/partials/` folders if they do not already exist. Now you can add the HTML code you want to your copy of the file, which will override Academic's version.
