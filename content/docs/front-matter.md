Front matter allows page-specific variables to be included at the top of a Markdown file using [TOML format](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/README.md), set between triple-plus `+++` lines. The variables may include metadata such as page title, date published, author, categories, tags, and so on. Here is a simple example:

```toml
+++
date = 2017-12-01
title = "My first blog post"
+++
```
