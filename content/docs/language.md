Both the **interface** and **content** language can be changed to suit your needs.

## Interface

The **Interface Language** is used to change the language throughout your site. The following interface languages are currently available: English, 中文 (简体), Español, Português, Deutsch, Euskara, Français, Italiano, 한국어, Nederlands, Polski, Русский, Türkçe, and Tiếng Việt.

The interface text is stored in language files which are collected from Academic's `themes/academic/i18n/` folder, as well as an `i18n/` folder at the root of your project.

To edit the interface text, copy `themes/academic/i18n/en.yaml` to `i18n/en.yaml` (relative to the root of your website). Open the new file and make any desired changes to the text appearing after `translation:`. Note that the language files are formatted in YAML syntax.

To translate the interface text to another language, follow the above instructions, but name the new file in the form `i18n/X.yaml` where `X` is the appropriate [ISO/RFC5646 language identifier](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) for the translation. Then follow the brief instructions in the *Language* section at the bottom of your `config.toml`. To change the default language used by Academic, set `defaultContentLanguage` to the desired language identifier in your configuration file.

To translate the navigation bar, you can edit the default `[[menu.main]]` instances in `config.toml`. However, for a multilingual site, you will need to duplicate all of the `[[menu.main]]` instances and rename the new instances from `[[menu.main]]` to `[[Languages.X.menu.main]]`, where `X` is the language identifier (e.g. `[[Languages.zh.menu.main]]` for Simplified Chinese). Thus, the navigation bar can be displayed in multiple languages.

## Content

To translate a content file in your `content/` folder into another language, copy the file to `filename.X.md` where `filename` is your existing filename and `X` is the appropriate [ISO/RFC5646 language identifier](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) for the translation. Then translate the content in the new file to the specified language.

If a page has been translated into multiple languages, a language chooser will appear in the navigation bar to allow the user to select which language they would like to view the page in.
