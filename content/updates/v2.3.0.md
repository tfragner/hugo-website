## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the July 2018 release of Academic. There are a number of updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- Option to **display author names in blog posts**
- [Google Docs shortcode]({{< ref "docs/writing-markdown-latex.md#embed-documents" >}}) now works with **all types** of document (Slides, Sheets, Docs, etc.)
- **New `list_tags` and `list_categories` shortcodes** to list links to all tags and categories
- Automatically link to your **privacy policy** in page footer and from the cookie consent "learn more"

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v2.2.0:

- [View changes](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0#files_bucket) to `config.toml` - scroll down to the changes for the `exampleSite/config.toml` file
- Hugo v0.38+ required
- Google Docs shortcode now requires `src` attribute - details below
  
## Content pages

- posts: Add option to display author names
  - To enable, add `authors = ["Me", "You"]` to the post front matter
- projects: Fix list of talks
- List all projects at `/project/` URL (mainly for SEO)
- Change style of tags to avoid confusion between tags and link buttons

## Plugins

- [Google Docs shortcode]({{< ref "docs/writing-markdown-latex.md#embed-documents" >}}) now supports all doc types (Slides, Docs, Sheets, etc.)
  - Shortcode syntax changed to: {{</* gdocs src="https://..." */>}}
  - The new `src` attribute should point to the Google Docs `embed` URL rather than `link` URL (see updated [documentation]({{< ref "docs/writing-markdown-latex.md#embed-documents" >}}))
- New `list_tags` and `list_categories` shortcodes
  - Use `{{</* list_tags */>}}` to provide a list of linked tags.
  - Use `{{</* list_categories */>}}` to provide a list of linked categories.

## Other

- privacy: Automatically link to your privacy policy in page footer and from the cookie consent "learn more"
  - To enable, create a privacy policy at `content/privacy.md` using the [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/exampleSite/content/privacy.md)
