## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the January 2018 release of Academic. There are a number of updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- Add *dark* and *1950s* themes (see preview below)
- Add gallery and featurette plugins
- Enable your site to be installed to the home screen of a mobile device, providing users with quicker access and a richer experience
  - For example, if viewing this site in *Chrome for Android* on a mobile device, press the Chrome settings icon in the top right corner, press *Add to home screen* - a native-like app for the website will be installed to your home screen. A similar process can be followed for other mobile browsers such as *Firefox Mobile*.
- Enable modern web browsers to automatically load localized version of content in multilingual sites
- Add OpenStreetMap-based alternative to Google Maps (#360)
- Display any tags at the bottom of all content pages (not only for blog posts!)
